<p>My role was cross-functional in range of driver acquisition using job board to user growth writing promotional contents. Mostly, My day was resolving escalated delivery fraud related issues every day, and checking the signup rate of new delivery partners through Google Analyics and Spreadsheet dashboard. This dashboard automatically pulls the data from google analytics and shows the daily, weekely, and monthly conversion funnels.</p><br><br>Also, sorted the data on SQL to send the push notification to encourage reactivation and first delivery. Designed surveys to improve the delivery experience in quantitative way, and Interviewed individual delivery partners to listen to their delivery experiences in qualitative way. For users, I wrote promotional contents on Uber Eats blog considering SEO keywords, and other PPC advertising for search engines.<br><br>
