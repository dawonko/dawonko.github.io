<p>As an Account Executive Intern, my role was mainly help to launch new campaigns and writing a report about competitor brands' marketing activities including descriptions of newly launched products, digital marketing. social buzzword, and ATL/BTL activities. </p><br>For Tom Ford Beauty, Darphin, Estee Lauder, I listed influencers that matches with the target market and who could bring higher engagement with them. This social campaigns were made through not only YouTube, but media tie-up with <My Mad Beauty 3> and instagram paid ads of other magazines(Vogue, MarieClaire, W Korea, etc) and other influencers. Later I suggested other campaign strategies based on the knowledge I learned from this project, as I am a fast-learner. <br><br> Risabae X Tom Ford Beauty<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvgdRGGlKuo&t=250s <br><br> Darphin X My Mad Beauty 3<br> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZpW4Xce9eo <br><br> Hazel X Estee Lauder<br> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPkPAMdlx20&t=189s
