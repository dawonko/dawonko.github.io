<p>In order to maintain the brand's identity and active appeal, we thought about how we can deliver 'customizing' to the consumer group who may feel ‘customizing’ as a burden. 
</p><br>Customization was reinterpreted with a message telling them to know "Even Though You're not different, You're Fine.“ with the research about the main target and their trend.
<br>It was an opportunity to learn the power of subtle differences in meaning and the importance of changing perspective based on the analysis of the consumer group and the social trend.
