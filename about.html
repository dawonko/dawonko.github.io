					<p>Hi! Iâ€™m South Korean living in London, United Kingdom. I worked for FMCG brands, Consumer Application, Marketing Research, and Platform company as a data-driven marketing person. I love all the marketing related works that help engaging more people with the good products, getting a feedback and also meting those into the product development. This is such a fun work!.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Before that, I finished Bachelor program in Communication Studies, a concentration on communication theory, modern society and consumers, data communication. During my study, I interned at amazing companies, Advantage Austria, Ogilvy & Mather, and Uber Eats. I learned the way how to figure what consumers want and how to reach out to them in a persuasive way including campaigns to digital marketing. Basically, my strength is in Analysis, Ideation, Development.</p> 
<br>
<p>After unexpected closure of Uber Eats in South Korea, I decided to hone my data analysis skills, so this decision drove me to work for Kantar, the world leading marketing research firm. Here, I executed business researches to check the brand positioning, consumer behavior and the point of product development needed. This experience motivated me to try Kakaoâ€™s summer program that gives an opportunity to non-tech people about how to develop a service and its marketing. Though it was just a summer program, I utilized my problem-solving skills to daily inconveniences that we took it for granted but actually itâ€™s not. Iâ€™d like to use my skills not only product development but also marketing strategies that enables strong engagement with users/consumers.</p>
<br>
<p>Besides, I like enjoying artsâ€¦ I am not lyingâ€¦! I was studying musical before but changed my major into communication studies since I felt Iâ€™d like to study more broad range of people interactions. I went to high school in the United States, and also studied at Linkoping university in Sweden for one semester as an exchange student. Pretty international? Plus, I spent one of my summers at University of Groningen studying European business. This means, I love to see how people from different cultures behave, react, and act. My goal is a person who figures what he/she is like when just watching how they walk. Not kidding! <p>
<br>
<p>So If you want a connection with me, please reach out to me through the email address below, welcome anyone from anywhere! Hope you stay safe and always be happy! ðŸ˜Š </p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
