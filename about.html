					</h1>
					<span class="h2">Let's get to know each other!</span>
					<p>I worked for FMCG brands, Consumer Application, Marketing Research, and Platform company as a data-driven marketing person. I love all the marketing related works that help engaging more people with the good products, getting a feedback and also meting those into the product development. Such a fun work!.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Before that, I finished Bachelor program in Communication Studies, a concentration on communication theory, and data communication. During my study, I interned at amazing companies, Advantage Austria, Ogilvy & Mather, and Uber Eats. I learned the way how to figure what consumers want and how to reach out to them in a persuasive way including campaigns to digital marketing. Basically, my strength is in Analysis, Ideation, Development.</p> 
<br>
<p>After unexpected closure of Uber Eats in South Korea, I decided to hone my data analysis skills, so this decision drove me to work for Kantar, the world leading marketing research firm. Here, I executed business researches to check the brand positioning, consumer behavior and the point of product development needed. This experience motivated me to try Kakaoâ€™s summer program that gives a product opportunity to non-tech people, I utilized my problem-solving skills to daily inconveniences that we take it for granted but actually itâ€™s not. Iâ€™d like to use my skills not only product development but also marketing strategies that enables strong engagement with future users.</p>
<br>
